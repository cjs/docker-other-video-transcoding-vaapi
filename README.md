# README

The goal here is to produce a Docker image that can be run on a NAS server to transcode media files

spacecowboy/transcode_docker works perfectly if you want software encoding, but this combines a version of https://github.com/lisamelton/other_video_transcoding with a prebuilt FFMpeg image with some other prior work that I found.

This is based on:

- https://github.com/lisamelton/other_video_transcoding
- https://github.com/spacecowboy/transcode_docker
- https://github.com/martinpickett/docker-other-transcode-mp
- https://github.com/joedefen/ffmpeg-vaapi-docker
